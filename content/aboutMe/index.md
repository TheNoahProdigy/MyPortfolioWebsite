![A pic of me](aboutMePic.jpg)

Hello, I'm Noah. Thank you for taking interest in learning more about me!

## Background
I was born in Ottawa and grew up in a small town an hour away from the city. When I was growing up, my father suggested to me that I should try coding. At the time, I was more interested in playing video games. After I graduated from high school, I was determined to go to university at Carleton, but I wasn't sure what I wanted to pursue. Initially, I set my major as undeclared, and took a mixture of mathematics, physics, and a single computer science class. It was this class that made me fall in love with programming, as I found it to be quite like a puzzle (in what way can I combine these tools to solve this problem?). I was hooked, and the very next semester, I was a computer science student. I decided to choose computer game development as my concentration. I'd soon find out that my physics and math knowledge would be vital for success in this field, and that making games can be just as fun as playing them. In a weird way, although I was too busy playing games to try coding as my dad had suggested, it kinda came full circle and now I enjoy programming and making video games.

## Interests
### Game Development
I played games throughout my childhood, and they made me incredibly happy. I love programming, and game development is the perfect combination, where the final product is a fun game for someone to enjoy. My dream is to start a game development studio that will offer experiences which bring the same joy I felt from games when I was a kid. 

### AI
I am fascinated by modern AI and its potential applications and implications for our lives. I am interested in how I could use it to build better and more enjoyable gaming experiences. Â 

I am considering pursuing a master's degree in AI to deepen my theoretical knowledge of the subject past my undergrad courses. 

### Software Development 
Software development, like game development, is about using the tools available to solve problems. To me, it feels like a satisfying puzzle. The result might be an app that helps someone track calories or navigate a new city. Whatever the case, it improves lives. My hope is to be part of a team whose application makes life easier in some way.

## Outside of Work
Outside of work, I love playing PC games, as well as building PCs. I've built several PCs from scratch, including my own, my partner's, and my friend's PCs. 

I also regularly go to the gym (~4 years now), and I track everything I eat to meet my fitness and health goals. 

I play sports with my friends, like basketball and rock climbing. I enjoy improving over time and pushing myself.
