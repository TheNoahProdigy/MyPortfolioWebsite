<meta name="description" content="About Me

Hello, I&rsquo;m Noah. Thank you for taking interest in learning more about me!
Background
I was born in Ottawa and grew up in a small town an hour away from the city. When I was growing up, my father suggested to me that I should try coding. At the time, I was more interested in playing video games. After I graduated from high school, I was determined to go to university at Carleton, but I wasn&rsquo;t sure what I wanted to pursue. Initially, I set my major as undeclared, and took a mixture of mathematics, physics, and a single computer science class. It was this class that made me fall in love with programming, as I found it to be quite like a puzzle (in what way can I combine these tools to solve this problem?). I was hooked, and the very next semester, I was a computer science student. I decided to choose computer game development as my concentration. I&rsquo;d soon find out that my physics and math knowledge would be vital for success in this field, and that making games can be just as fun as playing them. In a weird way, although I was too busy playing games to try coding as my dad had suggested, it kinda came full circle and now I enjoy programming and making video games.">
